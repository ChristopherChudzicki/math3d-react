/**
 * ScrollWithOverflow is a component intended to allow scrolling in the
 * y-direction and overflow in the x-direction.
 *
 * Naively, this would just be achieved by setting
 *    overflow-x: visible;
 *    overflow-y: scroll;
 * on whatever div you want. But that doesn't work:
 *    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6421966/css-overflow-x-visible-and-overflow-y-hidden-causing-scrollbar-issue
 * This component solves the problem by adding positive padding and
 * negative margin:
 *  padding-right: 100vw;
 *  margin-right: -100vw;
 * so that children can appear to overflow without actually overflowing.
 *
 * This approach has a few downsides:
 *  1. Other elements in the padding region do not receive pointer events.
 *    - solved by conditional application of pointer-events:none
 *  2. The scrollbar disappears (pushed by padding)
 *    - TODO: Solve this, or at least alleviate with other styling (like
 *      top/bottom shadows) to indicate scrolling
 * Not ideal, but the best I've got for now...
