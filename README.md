# Math3d-React

## To Install

This repository has two `package.json` files; as such, there are two places to run `npm` commands:

- `/package.json`: configuration for the express server
- `/react-ui/package.json`: configuration the user interface. *Most of the app is here.*

First, install server dependencies and start the server:
```bash
> npm install
> npm start
```
In a new terminal window, install ui dependencies and start:
```bash
> cd react-ui
> npm install
> npm start
```

The math3d-react app is now being served on `http://localhost:3000/`.
